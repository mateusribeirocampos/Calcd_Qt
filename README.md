# App: Calculator ---> Calcd
## Description: 
The calculator was a personal project to build the calculator from the Qt framework Desktop_Qt_6_3_2_MinGW_64_bit. The programming language used for the Qt for develop the App calculator was C++. I try to learn the C++ language programming together with framework to give a face for this little project.
